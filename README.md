# A Synthetic Biology Procedures Simplifier
Defhacks 2020 submission. Breaks down synthetic biology protocols into elementary steps.

Project outline:

Sythetic biology allows the production of enzymes from a bacterial culture. Importantly, the production of reagents for viral diagnostics can be achieved through synthetic biology. However, the potential of Synbio to increase viral testing accessibility is hampered by a lack of trained healthcare professionals and biologists who can carry out lab procedures. While plasmids can proliferate around the world, can the knowledge required to use them do so as well?

In order to solve this pressing issue with synthetic biology, we created a conversion utility from standard protocol formats. We envision scientists who would like to disseminate plasmids to use this software to create easy to follow and reproducible walkthroughs.

The example use of this utility is the LAMP-DETECTR diagnostic as listed here: https://mammoth.bio/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/A-protocol-for-rapid-detection-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2-using-CRISPR-diagnostics-SARS-CoV-2-DETECTR.pdf.
However, we also envision this tool being used to make many synthetic biology protocols simpler, or even as part of a workflow.
