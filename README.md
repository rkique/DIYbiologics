Defhacks 2020 submission. Convert synthetic biology protocols into AR walkthroughs.

Project outline:

Sythetic biology allows the production of enzymes from a bacterial culture. Importantly, the production of reagents for viral diagnostics can be achieved through synthetic biology. However, the potential of Synbio to increase viral testing accessibility is hampered by a lack of trained healthcare professionals and biologists who can carry out lab procedures. 

In order to solve this, we will create or automate a conversion process from standard protocol formats to an AR format.

Specifically, we will demonstrate this for a rapid and robust testing protocol found here: https://mammoth.bio/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/A-protocol-for-rapid-detection-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2-using-CRISPR-diagnostics-SARS-CoV-2-DETECTR.pdf. However, we envision this tool being used to make many synthetic biology protocols simpler.

By converting these protocols into AR walkthroughs or other highly accessible formats, laypeople with no experience working with sythetic biology can conduct basic procedures, such as growing bacteria, lyophilization, and LAMP diagnostic assays. In combination with a small set of supplies and bacterial plasmids, this allows for distributed test production in communities, by communities.
